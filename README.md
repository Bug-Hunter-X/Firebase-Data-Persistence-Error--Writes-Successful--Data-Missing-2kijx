This repository demonstrates a peculiar bug encountered in a Firebase project. Despite successful write operations indicated on the client-side, data failed to persist in the Firebase Realtime Database. The bug.js file showcases the original code leading to this issue, while bugSolution.js offers a corrected version.  The problem seems to stem from incorrect usage of asynchronous operations and lack of proper error handling. The solution demonstrates the importance of handling asynchronous write operations and using appropriate error handling techniques.
